# Analysis Engines

This document explains what each engine contributes and how findings should be interpreted.

---

## MobSF

- Broad static heuristics
- Manifest / plist analysis
- Crypto, network, permissions checks
- Produces many findings → requires triage

Confidence: **Medium**  
Use as a signal generator, not ground truth.

---

## apktool (Android)

- Decodes AndroidManifest.xml
- Extracts resources and configuration

High value for:
- Exported components
- Permissions
- Network security config

---

## jadx (Android)

- Java/Kotlin decompilation
- Enables manual and automated code review

High value for:
- Hardcoded logic
- Insecure API usage
- Debug code

---

## APKLeaks (Android)

- Pattern-based extraction of secrets and endpoints

High false-positive rate, but good coverage.

---

## Quark Engine (Android)

- Rule-based behavioral analysis
- Identifies suspicious capability combinations

Best used for threat modeling support.

---

## iOS Entitlements (codesign)

- Extracts app entitlements
- Identifies risky capabilities (e.g. get-task-allow)

macOS only.

---

## Secret Scanner (Built-in)

- Pattern-based detection of API keys, tokens, JWTs
- Scans decompiled and extracted assets

Confidence: **High**  
Hardcoded secrets are always a valid finding.
